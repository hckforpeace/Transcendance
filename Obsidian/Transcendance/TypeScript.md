## A Static Type Checker

We said earlier that some languages wouldn’t allow those buggy programs to run at all. Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as _static checking_. Determining what’s an error and what’s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static _type_ checking.
TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the _kinds of values_, making it a _static type checker_.

### Syntax
TypeScript is a language that is a _superset_ of JavaScript: JS syntax is therefore legal TS.
